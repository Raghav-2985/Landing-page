## 🛠 Built With
* HTML5
* CSS3 (Flexbox & Custom Properties)

## 💡 What I Learned
During this project, I focused on mastering **Flexbox** layout techniques. 
- I learned how to structure a multi-section page using semantic HTML.
- I practiced using `flex-direction` and `justify-content` to align complex hero sections.
- I made the intentional decision to update the copyright date to 2025 and added a "Desktop View" notice for mobile users.

## ⚠️ Important Note
This site is currently **non-responsive**. For the best experience, please view it on a desktop browser. I plan to revisit this project to add mobile responsiveness after completing the CSS Intermediate lessons!
